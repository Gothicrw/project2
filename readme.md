# Regie's Bites Restaurant - Bootstrap Website

This code provides the HTML structure for a simple, responsive website for a fictional restaurant named "Regie's Bites." It leverages the Bootstrap CSS framework for its layout and styling, ensuring a consistent and mobile-friendly design. It also incorporates Font Awesome for social media icons in the footer.

The website features a dark-themed header with a navigation bar containing links to the Home, Menu, About Us, and Contact sections. The main content starts with a prominent hero section, displaying a restaurant-related background image, a large title ("Savor the Flavor"), a welcoming tagline ("Experience our exquisite dishes."), and a primary call-to-action button to view the menu.

The "Menu" section showcases three example dishes (Trio of Dips, Spaghetti Pesto Perfection, and Pistachio Dream Tiramisu) using Bootstrap cards. Each card includes a placeholder image, the dish name, a brief description, and its price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh). The "About Us" section provides a paragraph describing the restaurant's atmosphere and culinary philosophy, accompanied by a placeholder image of the restaurant's interior. The "Contact Us" section includes a basic form with fields for name, email address, and a message, along with a submit button. The footer is dark-themed and displays copyright information along with placeholders for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram icons. The website also includes links to Bootstrap's JavaScript libraries for potential interactive features and a placeholder for a Font Awesome kit to manage the icons.
